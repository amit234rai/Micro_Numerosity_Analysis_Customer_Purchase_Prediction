Customer Purchase Prediction & Micro-Numerosity Analysis
Project Overview
This project, developed during my internship at the YBI Foundation, focuses on predicting customer purchase behavior. It uses a machine learning model to analyze demographic information and customer reviews to forecast whether a customer is likely to make a purchase.

A key part of this project is a Micro-Numerosity analysis, which specifically investigates how small-scale numerical features affect the accuracy of purchase predictions. The insights from this analysis help improve the predictive model and provide a deeper understanding of the subtle factors that influence customer decisions.

Key Steps
Data Preprocessing: The dataset was prepared by defining target and feature variables and encoding categorical data for model readiness.

Model Development: A Random Forest Classifier was selected and trained on the data to predict purchase outcomes.

Model Evaluation: The model's performance was rigorously evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Feature Importance: The project includes a visualization of feature importance, highlighting the key factors that most influence customer purchase predictions.

Performance Visualization: A confusion matrix heatmap and a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve were created to visually represent the model's performance and discriminative power.

Key Takeaways
The model achieved a 60% accuracy on the test set.

Feature importance analysis revealed the most influential factors in predicting customer purchases.

The confusion matrix and ROC curve provided a detailed look at the model's performance, including its true positive and false positive rates.

An analysis of predicted probability distributions offered insights into the model's confidence levels.

Future Improvements
Hyperparameter tuning of the Random Forest model to potentially enhance accuracy.

Exploring additional features or engineering new ones to improve predictive power.

Further iteration and refinement of the model and analysis to achieve better performance.
